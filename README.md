# disease-predictor

## The purpose of this project
### Develop a method that uses genetic data for disease classification

## Data
### Samples in the datasets represent patients. For each patient 7070 genes expressions (values) are measured in order to classify the patient’s disease into one of the following cases: EPD, JPA, MED, MGL, RHB.


## Primary processes: 
1. Cleaning the data.
2.  Select top genes by class
3. Find the best classifier/best gene set combination among Naïve Bayes, Decision tree, K-NN, A neural network and Logistic regression. 
6. Generating predictions for the test set. 
7. Generating a prediction using Adaptive Boosting.


## Comparing Model performance
